# DevTools

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/observability/devtools.md)

`agently-devtools` is an optional companion package. It consumes Agently observation events and provides local observation, evaluation, and interactive UI workflows. It is not the source of truth for workflow structure; TriggerFlow definitions and executions remain the source of truth.

## Install and listener

```bash
pip install -U agently agently-devtools
agently-devtools start
```

Default local endpoints from [`examples/devtools/README.md`](../../../examples/devtools/README.md):

| Surface | Default |
|---|---|
| DevTools console | `http://127.0.0.1:15596/` |
| Observation ingest | `http://127.0.0.1:15596/observation/ingest` |
| Interactive wrapper UI | `http://127.0.0.1:15365/` |

## ObservationBridge

The example path is [`examples/devtools/01_observation_bridge_local.py`](../../../examples/devtools/01_observation_bridge_local.py). It creates the bridge through Agently's LazyImport helper, watches the global runtime, runs a TriggerFlow, then unregisters the bridge:

```python
from agently import Agently

bridge = Agently.create_observation_bridge(
    app_id="agently-main-examples",
    group_id="devtools-local-demo",
)
bridge.watch(Agently)

try:
    ...
finally:
    bridge.unregister()
```

Use `Agently.create_observation_bridge(target, ...)` or `bridge.watch(target)` when only selected objects should be uploaded; see [`02_observation_bridge_selective_watch.py`](../../../examples/devtools/02_observation_bridge_selective_watch.py). `bridge.watch(...)` accepts the global `Agently` object, agents, model requests/responses, TriggerFlows, TriggerFlow executions, Dynamic Task / TaskDAG selectors, Skill executions, tool functions, or `{"target_type": ..., "target_name": ...}` mappings.

For a minimal example that keeps `agently_devtools` behind Agently's LazyImport facade, see [`07_agently_observe_lazy_bridge.py`](../../../examples/devtools/07_agently_observe_lazy_bridge.py).

The lower-level DevTools package can also bind at construction time:

```python
from agently import Agently
from agently_devtools import ObservationBridge

bridge = ObservationBridge(Agently)
bridge.watch(agent)
```

The older `bridge = ObservationBridge(...); bridge.register(Agently)` form remains compatible and emits a deprecation warning.

`ObservationBridge` uploads from a background queue and coalesces high-frequency observation events such as `model.streaming` before sending them to the listener. This keeps passive observation off the request/output path. For short scripts that exit immediately after a run, call `await bridge.flush()` before process exit if you need all buffered events uploaded.

## EvaluationBridge

[`03_scenario_evaluations.py`](../../../examples/devtools/03_scenario_evaluations.py) builds a small TriggerFlow, binds it with `EvaluationBinding`, and runs `EvaluationRunner` across multiple `EvaluationCase` inputs. Use this path for repeatable scenario checks, not for request-time validation inside application code.

## InteractiveWrapper

`InteractiveWrapper` can wrap:

- a plain callable or generator: [`04_interactive_wrapper_basic.py`](../../../examples/devtools/04_interactive_wrapper_basic.py)
- an Agently Agent: [`05_interactive_wrapper_agent.py`](../../../examples/devtools/05_interactive_wrapper_agent.py)
- a TriggerFlow that streams stage updates: [`06_interactive_wrapper_trigger_flow.py`](../../../examples/devtools/06_interactive_wrapper_trigger_flow.py)

For TriggerFlow, stream progress through `data.async_put_into_stream(...)`; the wrapper consumes the runtime stream and then shows the close snapshot.

## AgentTask action observations

AgentTask may project `agent_task.action.started`, `agent_task.action.completed`, and `agent_task.action.failed` RuntimeEvent records from bounded execution Action logs. DevTools should consume them as factual action observations in the AgentTask timeline, grouped by task iteration when iteration metadata is present.

Recovered `success` and `partial_success` records are completed observations, even when they carry backend diagnostics. Failed observations are reserved for failed, blocked, timed-out, or unrecovered error records.

These records are for display, logging, and post-run analysis only. Do not use them as route decisions, verifier results, quality scores, semantic relevance judgments, or task-completion acceptance. Unknown fields should be ignored, and large payloads should stay summarized or ref-backed.

## Model request usage

DevTools should consume model request usage from `payload.model_request_telemetry.usage_summary` when present, with compatible fallbacks to provider `usage` metadata on model meta or terminal events. Display usage at two scopes: the individual model request and the selected run branch with descendant model requests aggregated upward.

When provider token counts are unavailable, show token fields as unknown, for example `NaN`, and show estimated input/output character lengths as diagnostics only. Usage telemetry is observation-only; it must not become a framework budget cap, retry rule, route decision, quality score, verifier result, or task-completion acceptance.

## Compatibility boundary

DevTools consumers should fail open:

- ignore unknown observation event types and unknown payload fields
- prefer `run` lineage fields over parsing `message`
- treat TriggerFlow graphs as derived from flow definitions and runtime metadata, not as a separate manual graph

For release management, package versions are only part of the story. Unreleased branch work uses a runtime protocol declared by Agently in `agently/compatibility.py`; DevTools should compare that protocol first, then use package version ranges as upgrade guidance. Historical published manifests live under the Agently source registry at `compatibility/releases/<framework_version>.json`. For legacy published releases `4.1.0.2` through `4.1.1`, DevTools may fall back to the built-in legacy protocol mapping because those builds predate the manifest. Outside that legacy window, missing manifest support should be treated as unverified compatibility.

See [Event Center](event-center.md) for the observation event schema and alias rules.
