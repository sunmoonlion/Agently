# Event Center

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/observability/event-center.md)

The Event Center is Agently's framework-level runtime event channel. It carries **RuntimeEvent** records: model requests, Session application, TriggerFlow lifecycle, Action calls, and similar framework activity can be forwarded to DevTools or to a custom log sink through this channel.

It is separate from TriggerFlow `emit` / `when`: `emit` / `when` changes control flow inside a flow; RuntimeEvent records report what happened.

Naming compatibility:

- `RuntimeEvent` is the preferred framework event model for new code.
- Event Center dispatches `RuntimeEvent` records to ordinary hooks.
- `ObservationEvent` is the DevTools bridge projection derived from `RuntimeEvent`.
- Existing `emit_observation` / `async_emit_observation` code continues to work as a compatibility alias.

Run and retry naming:

- `agent_execution` is the run lineage kind for one AgentExecution-owned Agent run.
- `attempt_index` describes a retryable model-request attempt inside a request; it is not an AgentExecution counter.
- DevTools should preserve both fields as separate semantics: render `agent_execution` from `run.run_kind`, and read model retry attempts from `payload.attempt_index` or `run.meta.attempt_index` on `model_request` runs.

Model request telemetry:

- Model RuntimeEvents may include `payload["model_request_telemetry"]` on `model.request_started`, `model.requesting`, `model.status`, `model.completed`, `model.meta`, `model.request_failed`, and `model.requester.error`.
- The telemetry payload is observation-only. It can contain `response_id`, `attempt_index`, run ids, provider/model, request URL, duration, raw usage, normalized usage summary, estimated input/output character lengths, side-channel, and normalized error facts.
- Telemetry dedupe only removes duplicate telemetry sub-payloads for the same `response_id + attempt_index + event kind`; it does not suppress the original RuntimeEvent.
- Do not feed these telemetry facts back into route selection, retry policy, verifier judgment, quality scoring, planner context, or prompt content. Use them for logs, DevTools display, and diagnostics.

Model request status:

- `model.status` records a ModelRequest attempt outcome. It is observation-only;
  it does not decide retry or downstream control flow.
- The raw response stream event is `("status", payload)`; `instant` /
  `streaming_parse` exposes it as `StreamingData(path="$status", value=payload)`.
- `payload["status"]` is `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.
- `failed` with `retry=true` invalidates partial output from
  `payload["attempt_index"]`; the next attempt is
  `payload["next_attempt_index"]`. Consumers must clear provisional output
  before rendering replacement deltas.
- `reason` carries a bounded provider/transport explanation and `error_type`
  carries the original exception class when available. It is not a traceback or
  a raw request body.
- Text-only `type="delta"` generators receive a standalone
  `"<$retry>{reason}</$retry>"` chunk at that replay boundary. They must clear
  provisional text on the marker; use `type="all"`, `specific`, `instant`, or
  `streaming_parse` when lineage or collision-free structured facts are
  required.

## Register a hook

```python
from agently import Agently

captured = []


async def capture(event):
    captured.append(event)


Agently.event_center.register_hook(
    capture,
    event_types="runtime.info",
    hook_name="docs.capture",
)

emitter = Agently.event_center.create_emitter("Docs")
await emitter.async_info("hello")

Agently.event_center.unregister_hook("docs.capture")
```

`event_types` can be a string, a list of strings, or `None`. With `None`, the hook receives every event. Sync callbacks are accepted too; Event Center normalizes them to async calls.

Hooks that forward high-frequency runtime events to an expensive outlet can ask
Event Center to summarize delivery:

```python
Agently.event_center.register_hook(
    capture,
    event_types="model.response.delta",
    hook_name="docs.summary_capture",
    delivery_policy={
        "mode": "summary",
        "dispatch": "await",
        "emit_interval": 0.1,
        "max_items": 20,
        "high_frequency_only": True,
    },
)
```

The default delivery policy is raw and awaited. Summary delivery is per hook; it
does not change the producer's RuntimeEvent records or other hooks that request
raw events. Summary events carry `meta["coalesced"]`, `coalesced_count`,
`first_event_id`, and `last_event_id`.

Use `dispatch="background"` only for best-effort outlets that have an explicit
flush/close point. `await Agently.event_center.async_flush(hook_name)` drains
buffered summaries and tracked background deliveries before shutdown.
Event Center also runs an on-demand idle flush monitor while background
deliveries or summary buffers exist: each new event refreshes the idle timer,
and a quiet period triggers bounded flushing. This is a long-lived-loop safety
net, not a replacement for explicit flush before CLI/script shutdown.

## Emit a runtime event

Agently-owned event types such as `model.*`, `request.*`, `action.*`,
`tool.*`, `session.*`, `agent_execution.*`, `triggerflow.*`, and
`execution_resource.*` are produced by core runtime coordinators. Custom
plugins and applications may emit their own Event Center messages, but they
should use an application/plugin-owned namespace and must not rely on official
Agently modules consuming those custom messages.

Built-in plugins report facts to core through typed observations, handler
decisions, or route stream callbacks. Core-owned coordinators map those facts
into official RuntimeEvent records and AgentExecution stream items.

The usual path is an emitter:

```python
emitter = Agently.event_center.create_emitter(
    "BillingWorker",
    base_meta={"tenant": "demo"},
)

await emitter.async_emit(
    "billing.invoice_created",
    message="invoice created",
    payload={"invoice_id": "inv-1"},
)
```

You can also emit a dict directly:

```python
await Agently.event_center.async_emit({
    "event_type": "runtime.info",
    "source": "Docs",
    "message": "direct event",
})
```

For top-level convenience APIs:

```python
await Agently.async_emit_observation({
    "event_type": "runtime.info",
    "source": "Docs",
    "message": "compatibility observation API",
})

await Agently.async_emit_runtime({
    "event_type": "runtime.info",
    "source": "Docs",
    "message": "runtime API",
})
```

## Event shape

The top-level fields come from `agently.types.data.event.RuntimeEvent`. `ObservationEvent` has the same serialized shape when the main framework DevTools bridge projects RuntimeEvent records for DevTools ingestion:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_id` | event id, generated by default |
| `event_type` | dotted name such as `triggerflow.execution_started` |
| `source` | where the event came from |
| `level` | `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL` |
| `message` | human-readable message |
| `payload` | event-specific structured data |
| `error` | error information; exceptions are normalized to `ErrorInfo` |
| `run` | run lineage, including `run_id`, `parent_run_id`, `session_id`, `execution_id`, and related ids |
| `meta` | additional metadata |
| `timestamp` | millisecond timestamp |

For model request events, `payload.model_request_telemetry` is an extensible sub-payload. Consumers should treat missing fields as unknown, not as failure. Common fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_kind` | original model event kind that carried the telemetry |
| `telemetry_key` | dedupe key, usually `response_id:attempt_index:event_kind` |
| `response_id` | request/response correlation id |
| `attempt_index` | retry attempt number inside the request |
| `request_run_id` / `model_run_id` | run lineage ids for request and model attempt |
| `provider` / `provider_family` / `model` | provider metadata when known |
| `request_url` | provider endpoint or provider-owned symbolic URL when known |
| `duration_ms` | elapsed time from model request start when available |
| `usage` | provider-reported usage metadata when available |
| `usage_summary` | observation-only usage summary with normalized provider token fields and estimated input/output character lengths; terminal `model.status` events may carry estimated lengths without exposing raw request payloads; missing provider tokens should be displayed as unknown, not as a failure |
| `side_channel` | whether the model event came from a side-channel request path |
| `error` | normalized error facts for failed/requester-error events |

## TriggerFlow event aliases

Event Center keeps compatibility with historical TriggerFlow event prefixes. A subscription to `workflow.execution_started` can receive `triggerflow.execution_started`; a subscription to `trigger_flow.signal` can receive `triggerflow.signal`. Documentation and new code should prefer `triggerflow.*`.

## Action compatibility events

Action Runtime lifecycle events use `action.*` as the primary namespace. When the current Action Runtime branch is tool-compatible, Agently also emits paired `tool.*` compatibility events for existing subscribers and old examples:

| Primary event | Tool compatibility event |
|---|---|
| `action.loop_started` | `tool.loop_started` |
| `action.plan_ready` | `tool.plan_ready` |
| `action.loop_failed` | `tool.loop_failed` |
| `action.loop_completed` | `tool.loop_completed` |

Paired compatibility events include `meta.compat_event_alias=True`, `meta.compat_alias_for`, and `meta.primary_event_id` so consumers can deduplicate them from the primary `action.*` event.

Concrete action execution uses `action.started`, `action.completed`, and
`action.failed`. Policy or sandbox gates that stop an action before normal
execution use `action.approval_required` or `action.blocked` instead of being
reported as ordinary failures. For tool-backed actions, `payload.action_type`
may be `"tool"`; that does not change the event family.

## ExecutionResource events

ExecutionResource lifecycle uses `execution_resource.*`. Providers and
DevTools consumers should treat this namespace as extensible. Current manager
events include `declared`, `approval_required`, `ensuring`, `ready`,
`unhealthy`, `releasing`, `released`, and `failed`. `unhealthy` means a ready
handle failed the health check before reuse; the manager releases it and ensures
a fresh handle.

## Runtime Progress And Stall Diagnostics

Event Center is the runtime-event intake and outlet dispatch layer. Liveness
state is updated before expensive hook delivery, so a slow or failing hook must
not block stall diagnostics.

AgentExecution records progress in `async_get_meta()["diagnostics"]`:

- `diagnostics["stages"]["events"]` keeps recent stage progress.
- `diagnostics["last_progress"]` records the latest accepted progress event.
- `diagnostics["timeouts"]` records hard-deadline failures.
- `diagnostics["stalls"]` records idle no-progress failures.

When debugging a live app, attach a temporary Event Center hook or enable
console logs with `.set_settings("debug", True)` for request/result and process
summaries, or `.set_settings("debug", "detail")` for full observation and model
delta output. Remove temporary debug hooks and debug settings after the issue is
understood.

## Compatibility rules

RuntimeEvent records are an extensible framework event protocol. Agently-DevTools and custom consumers should fail open:

- Ignore unknown top-level fields and unknown `payload` fields.
- Do not fail on unknown `event_type` values.
- Do not treat `payload` as a closed schema; it can grow per event type.
- When correlating a request, Session, or TriggerFlow execution, prefer `run` fields over parsing `message`.
