# Action Runtime

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/actions/action-runtime.md)

Agently's action stack has three replaceable plugin layers below the orchestration layer:

```text
   TriggerFlow                  ◄── orchestration above actions (loops, branches, pause/resume)
       │
       ▼
   ActionRuntime                ◄── planning + dispatch
       │  (uses ActionFlow as the bridge to the orchestration layer)
       ▼
   ActionExecutor               ◄── atomic execution (local function, MCP, sandbox)
```

## Layers in detail

| Layer | What it owns | Default builtin |
|---|---|---|
| `TriggerFlow` | high-level orchestration above actions (loops, branches, pause/resume, sub-flow) — see [TriggerFlow](../triggerflow/overview.md) | the `TriggerFlow` core |
| `ActionRuntime` | planning protocol, action call normalization, default execution orchestration | `AgentlyActionRuntime` |
| `ActionFlow` | bridge between an `ActionRuntime` and a flow representation | `TriggerFlowActionFlow` |
| `ActionExecutor` | how one action actually runs | local function, MCP, Python/Bash sandbox, Search/Browse, Node.js, Docker, SQLite executors |
| `ExecutionResource` | managed execution dependencies required before an executor call | MCP, Bash, Python, Node, Docker, Browser, SQLite providers |

`Action` in `agently.core` is a façade that wires:

- `ActionRegistry` and `ActionDispatcher` (stable core primitives)
- one active `ActionRuntime` plugin
- one active `ActionFlow` plugin

Default wiring:

```text
Agent → ActionExtension → Action façade → ActionRuntime → ActionFlow → ActionExecutor
```

## Plugin types

The plugin types you can replace are:

- `ActionRuntime` — for changing the planning protocol or call normalization
- `ActionFlow` — for changing the orchestration shape (e.g., custom flow representation)
- `ActionExecutor` — for adding a new backend (HTTP, gRPC, custom sandbox, remote worker)

Import the protocols and handler aliases from `agently.types.plugins`:

```python
from agently.types.plugins import (
    ActionExecutor,
    ActionRuntime,
    ActionFlow,
    ActionPlanningHandler,
    ActionExecutionHandler,
)
```

> The older `ToolManager` plugin type and `AgentlyToolManager` class are kept for explicit legacy use only and emit deprecation warnings once per deprecated API per Python process, unless `runtime.show_deprecation_warnings` is disabled. Don't write new plugins against `ToolManager`.

## The preferred surface — actions

For new code:

```python
from agently import Agently

agent = Agently.create_agent()


@agent.action_func
async def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers."""
    return a + b


@agent.action_func
async def python_code_executor(python_code: str):
    """Execute Python code and return the result."""
    ...


agent.use_actions([add, python_code_executor])

# Or register and run in one shot
@agent.auto_func
def calculate(formula: str) -> int:
    """Compute {formula}. Use available actions."""
    ...

print(calculate("3333+6666=?"))
```

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@agent.action_func` | mark a function as an action, derive its schema from signature + docstring |
| `agent.use_actions(actions)` | register a list, single action, or string-named action with the agent |
| `agent.use_actions(["name1", "name2"])` | register pre-registered actions by name |
| `agent.use_actions(Search(...))` | mount the built-in Search package from `agently.builtins.actions` |
| `agent.use_actions(Browse(...))` | mount the built-in Browse package from `agently.builtins.actions` |
| `agent.enable_python(...)` | mount a managed `run_python` action for deterministic code execution |
| `agent.enable_shell(...)` | mount a managed `run_bash` action with workspace roots, command allowlists, timeouts, and bounded output previews |
| `agent.enable_nodejs(...)` | mount a managed `run_nodejs` action |
| `agent.enable_sqlite(...)` | mount a managed `query_sqlite` action |
| `agent.enable_workspace_file_actions(...)` | expose the current Workspace file area as handler-backed list/search/read/write actions, plus `export_file` when `export=True` and `write=True` |
| `agent.enable_coding_agent_actions(...)` | expose coding-agent Workspace actions for file readback, glob/grep search, targeted edit, unified-diff patch, and guarded full-file writes |
| `@agent.auto_func` | turn a Python function signature + docstring into a model-backed implementation that uses the agent's actions |
| `agent.get_action_result(prompt=turn.prompt)` | retrieve action call records for a request-scoped turn |
| `extra.action_logs` | structured logs produced during the action loop |

`agent.action.get_action_info()` and `agent.action.get_tool_info()` return the
visible action/tool schemas registered on that agent by default, including
agent-scoped actions, MCP tools mounted through `agent.use_mcp(...)`, and
`enable_*` component helpers. Pass explicit `tags=[...]` only when you need a
narrow subset. Managed execution environment metadata redacts raw `env` values
in this visible schema while preserving key names; providers still receive the
raw env only through the execution path.

For application code, prefer `enable_*` helpers when the goal is to give the
model a common capability such as Python, shell, or workspace access. Use
`register_action(..., executor=..., execution_resources=[...])` when you are
building a custom Action backend.

For coding-agent style local file work, prefer
`agent.enable_coding_agent_actions(...)`. It exposes `read_file`,
`glob_files`, `grep_files`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch`, and guarded
`write_file` over the current Workspace file root. `edit_file(...)` can use an
`expected_sha256` stale guard, `apply_patch(...)` applies a unified diff and can
require exact `expected_files`, and `write_file(...)` in coding-agent mode
requires either prior read state or an expected hash unless the host disables
that guard. Use shell for tests, builds, git inspection, and read-only
diagnostics; use Workspace file actions for file reading, search, editing, and
writing.

When `agent.enable_shell(...)` is called without an explicit `commands=...`
allowlist, Agently uses a small safe shell profile for commands such as `pwd`,
`ls`, `rg`, `cat`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `python -m pytest`, and
`python -m pyright`. Stdout and stderr are returned as bounded previews; if a
stream exceeds `max_output_chars`, the full stream is written under the
Workspace root at `artifacts/shell/` and referenced from the action result.

Built-in capability packages live under `agently.builtins.actions`. For example:

```python
from agently.builtins.actions import Browse, Search

agent.use_actions(Search(timeout=15, backend="auto"))
agent.use_actions(Browse())
```

Search is an Action-native package and does not use ExecutionResource;
proxy, timeout, backend, and region are package/executor configuration. Browse
is also Action-native; its default path is Playwright -> restricted curl -> BS4,
while pyautogui is kept as legacy/advanced configuration. The curl backend is a
Browse-internal URL fetch fallback, not model-visible shell access. If a Browse action needs a managed
browser/page/session, register it with a Browser ExecutionResource provider enabled.

Agent Client Protocol (ACP) coding agents are exposed as Action capability, not
as an AgentExecution route. Use `agent.use_acp(on_missing="skip")` to
scan local ACP endpoints and built-in local coding-agent CLI adapters, then
register `acp_list_agents` plus `acp_run_task` only when a runnable agent is
verified. `acp_list_agents` also returns non-binding adapter-name hints for
common ACP adapters such as `codex`, `claude code` / `cc`, `openclaw`,
`hermes` / `hermes agent`, and `gemini`; these hints do not make an agent
runnable. Built-in local CLI adapters cover common Codex and Claude Code command
locations in addition to the current process `PATH`; they use fixed
framework-owned argv templates and do not expose model-visible shell execution.
The default `on_missing="skip"` records diagnostics and avoids fake runnable
agents; `on_missing="error"` fails closed. ACP run actions declare
`ExecutionResource(kind="acp")` so root scope and lifecycle facts stay in the
resource layer. If `root` is omitted, `agent.use_acp()` uses the Agent's bound
Workspace `files_root` as the coding-agent project root; pass `root=...` only
when the host intentionally authorizes a different project directory. ACP
session reuse is an internal AgentExecution resource policy, not an ordinary
task-start option. CLI adapters are marked
`acp_session.persistence="stateless_cli"` unless a real protocol session is
available.

AgentTask can also use ACP as an opt-in recovery fallback after a bounded
step or TaskBoard card fails and configured retries are exhausted. This still
uses the registered `acp_run_task` Action plus `ExecutionResource(kind="acp")`;
ACP is not a route that bypasses AgentExecution or task strategy policy. If the
host never called `agent.use_acp(...)`, the fallback records skipped diagnostics
instead of importing ACP dependencies or inventing an agent.

The `desc=` argument on `enable_*` helpers is optional. By default it is appended
as additional guidance so the model still sees the baseline usage and safety
constraints. Use `desc_mode="override"` when you intentionally want to replace
the default description, or `desc_mode="default"` to ignore the supplied
description and keep only the built-in one.

## Model-sourced input safety

Action commands produced by model planning are treated as untrusted input at the
Action boundary. For `structured_plan` and `native_tool_calls` commands,
`ActionDispatcher` filters `action_input` to the keys declared in the registered
`ActionSpec.kwargs` before the executor is called. Direct host calls keep their
existing behavior and are not filtered this way.

Filtered calls keep structured diagnostics on the `ActionResult`, including
`action.input.unexpected_keys_stripped`, the stripped keys, and bounded previews
of the original and executed kwargs. Timeout and executor exceptions also return
structured Action failures with diagnostics. RuntimeEvent consumers may observe
those facts, but RuntimeEvent does not enforce input safety or authorization.

## Execution recall

Instruction-heavy actions such as `run_bash`, `run_python`, `run_nodejs`,
`query_sqlite`, `browse`, and `search` keep later model context compact by
recording an execution digest plus artifact references.

The digest is what the next action-planning round normally sees. It includes the
action id, call id, purpose, status, a compact instruction preview, result
preview, preview truncation metadata, redaction notes, artifact refs, and any
Workspace file refs returned by the Action. Full raw content such as complete
code, shell output, SQL rows, page HTML, screenshots, or logs is retained as a
redacted artifact instead of being inserted into every prompt. Artifact refs
include role, media type, size/bytes, preview size, SHA-256, and truncation
flags so consumers can tell that a preview is not complete evidence.
Actions that explicitly return `artifacts` or `artifact_refs` use the same
contract even when the output is small. This includes MCP resource/content
blocks surfaced by `MCPActionExecutor`; Agently records the declared artifact
metadata, but it does not infer undeclared file writes by scanning directories.
When the digest is still too large for later planning or reply hot paths,
Agently compacts the model-visible digest again: `result` keeps the bounded
digest, duplicate `data` / `model_digest` fields may become `same_as="result"`
pointers, and artifact refs omit preview bodies while keeping readback ids.
That compaction only applies to hot-path model context; full redacted content
stays in the Action artifact store for explicit readback.

When the model or application needs the omitted detail, read it explicitly:

```python
turn = agent.input("Use the action and summarize the result.")
records = agent.get_action_result(prompt=turn.prompt)
artifact_ref = records[0]["artifact_refs"][0]

raw = agent.action.read_action_artifact(
    artifact_id=artifact_ref["artifact_id"],
    action_call_id=artifact_ref["action_call_id"],
)
```

`Action.to_action_results(records)` uses the digest for instruction-heavy
actions, so follow-up replies can reason about what happened without receiving
the full payload by default.

`max_output_bytes` is an output evidence policy, not a destructive storage
operation. When an Action output exceeds it, Agently records diagnostics and
keeps the full value behind an artifact ref while the model-visible path
continues to use bounded previews.

When a host explicitly calls `agent.get_action_result(prompt=...)`, Agently
marks that prompt as having consumed the action loop even if the returned record
list is empty. A later response read for the same prompt will not re-enter
ActionRuntime just to materialize final text.

Use `agent.action.summarize_records(records)` when host code needs an
authoritative action-evidence summary:

```python
summary = agent.action.summarize_records(
    records,
    validation_command_markers=["pytest", "pyright"],
)

assert summary["latest_validation"]["status"] in {"passed", "failed"}
```

The summary reports failed actions, commands attempted, successful commands,
and the latest matching validation command.

## Compatibility surface — tools

The older surface still works:

```python
@agent.tool_func
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

agent.use_tool(add)
agent.use_tools([add])
agent.use_mcp("https://...")
agent.use_sandbox(...)
extra.tool_logs  # equivalent to extra.action_logs at the old surface
```

These remain valid public mounting surfaces. They map onto the new action runtime internally — they don't imply a `ToolManager` implementation. Migrate to the action surface when convenient; nothing breaks immediately.

## Planning model key

Action planning is a model-owned step. When an Agent uses `model_pool`, set
`action.planning_model_key` to the business model key that should plan action
rounds:

```python
agent.set_settings("model_pool", {"task-main": "deepseek-chat-prod"})
agent.set_settings("model_profiles", {
    "deepseek-chat-prod": {
        "provider": "OpenAICompatible",
        "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
        "model": "deepseek-chat",
        "api_key_pool": "deepseek-prod",
    }
})
agent.set_settings("action.planning_model_key", "task-main")
```

This applies to the default structured-plan and native tool-call planning
paths. It is especially important when a higher-level runtime such as
SkillsExecutor or AgentTask delegates a bounded action round to
ActionRuntime.

`agent.get_action_result(..., timeout=N)` bounds the full action loop,
including structured planning and native tool-call selection. If the loop
cannot finish before the deadline, Agently raises `RuntimeStageStallError` with
`stage="action_loop_close"`.

When `planning_protocol="native_tool_calls"` returns no provider-native tool
calls, Agently emits a skipped diagnostic action record with code
`action_runtime.native_tool_calls.empty`. Host code should treat that diagnostic
as planning evidence, not as executed work.

When consecutive rounds select the same failing action ids and none of those
records shows progress, the default `TriggerFlowActionFlow` closes the current
bounded action step and returns the failure evidence it already has. The default
threshold is `action.loop.max_consecutive_failed_rounds_per_action = 2`
(`tool.loop...` remains a compatibility alias). This is not a task budget; a
higher-level owner such as AgentTask can then verify, replan, or block from the
structured failure records.

## Handler interface

If you're writing a custom `ActionRuntime` or `ActionFlow` plugin, the planning and execution handlers use one stable two-argument contract:

```python
async def planning_handler(
    context: ActionRunContext,
    request: ActionPlanningRequest,
) -> ActionDecision:
    ...


async def execution_handler(
    context: ActionRunContext,
    request: ActionExecutionRequest,
) -> list[ActionResult]:
    ...
```

Context fields include `prompt`, `settings`, `agent_name`, `round_index`, `max_rounds`, `done_plans`, `last_round_records`, `action`, `runtime`. Request fields include `action_list`, `planning_protocol`, `action_calls`, `async_call_action`, `concurrency`, `timeout`.

Custom `ActionFlow` plugins may accept an optional
`runtime_observation_handler` keyword. If present, the flow should send
plain observation dictionaries to that handler instead of emitting official
`action.*` or `tool.*` RuntimeEvents directly; core maps those observations to
the official event stream.

There is no legacy positional handler signature — the public contract is `(context, request)` only.

## Extension guidance

| You want to change | Replace |
|---|---|
| Just the backend (HTTP, gRPC, remote worker, sandbox) | `ActionExecutor` |
| The planning protocol or how calls are normalized | `ActionRuntime` |
| The orchestration shape between runtime and flow | `ActionFlow` |
| Higher-level flow control over many action calls | use `TriggerFlow` above the runtime — don't embed it inside an executor |
| Lifecycle for MCP/sandbox/process-like dependencies | declare an `ExecutionResource` requirement — don't hide lifecycle inside an executor |
