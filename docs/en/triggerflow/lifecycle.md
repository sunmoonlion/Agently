# Lifecycle

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/triggerflow/lifecycle.md)

A TriggerFlow execution moves through three states. Five entry APIs let you control how it starts and ends.

## Three states

```text
   open  ──seal()──►  sealed  ──close()──►  closed
    │                                            │
    └─── (auto_close fires after idle timeout) ──┘
```

| State | What it accepts | What still runs |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | new external events (`emit`, `continue_with`) | everything: chunks, runtime stream, registered tasks |
| `sealed` | nothing new from outside | already-accepted events, internal `emit` chains, registered tasks continue to drain |
| `closed` | nothing | runtime stream is closed; close snapshot is frozen |

Key distinction: `seal()` stops external input but lets in-flight work finish. `close()` does seal first, then drains and freezes.

## Five entry APIs

| API | Purpose | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `flow.start(...)` / `flow.async_start(...)` | hidden-execution sugar; create + start + wait + close | close snapshot |
| `flow.start_execution(...)` / `flow.async_start_execution(...)` | explicit launch; you keep the execution handle | execution |
| `execution.start(...)` / `execution.async_start(...)` | start an execution you already created | close snapshot if `auto_close=True`; execution if `auto_close=False` |
| `execution.seal()` / `execution.async_seal()` | runtime seal | — |
| `execution.close()` / `execution.async_close()` | finalize | close snapshot |

### `flow.start(...)` — hidden sugar

```python
snapshot = await flow.async_start("input value")
```

What it does internally: `create_execution(auto_close=True, auto_close_timeout=0.0)`, start, wait until close, return snapshot.

Rules:

- **`auto_close=False` is illegal here** — raises immediately.
- `wait_for_result=` value is **ignored** with a warning. Return type is fixed to the close snapshot.
- `timeout=` is treated as `auto_close_timeout` — how long to wait after the last activity before auto-closing.
- If your flow uses `pause_for(...)`, do **not** use `flow.start()` — there is no handle for the outside to resume against. TriggerFlow fails fast when hidden execution sugar reaches `pause_for(...)`. Use `flow.start_execution(...)` or `flow.create_execution(...)`.

### `flow.start_execution(...)` — explicit launch

```python
execution = await flow.async_start_execution("input value")
# ... do something with the handle ...
snapshot = await execution.async_close()
```

Returns the execution. You decide when to close. Suited for services, SSE/WebSocket streams, human-in-the-loop, external `emit()` callers.

`wait_for_result=` is ignored here too.

### `execution.start(...)` — start a pre-built execution

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(auto_close=True)
snapshot = await execution.async_start("input")  # returns close snapshot
```

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(auto_close=False)
exec2 = await execution.async_start("input")  # returns the execution
# ... do work, then ...
snapshot = await execution.async_close()
```

| `auto_close` | `async_start` returns |
|---|---|
| `True` (default) | close snapshot |
| `False` | the execution itself |

Sync `start()` only supports `auto_close=True`. If your execution must be manually closed, use `await execution.async_start(...)` instead.

The value passed to `execution.async_start(value)` is the execution's start
input. It does not emit a custom event named by that value. Attach chunks that
should run from the start boundary with `flow.to(handler, name=...)`. If you
want a custom event such as `"start"`, start the execution and then call
`await execution.async_emit("start", payload)`.

### `execution.seal()` — stop new input, let in-flight finish

```python
await execution.async_seal()
```

After seal:

- New external `emit()` / `continue_with()` calls are rejected.
- Already-accepted events, internal `emit` chains, and registered tasks keep running.
- Runtime stream is **not** closed.
- Close snapshot is **not** frozen yet.

Use seal when you want to stop accepting new work but still finish what's in flight, and you'll close later (or let `auto_close` close it).

### `execution.close()` — finalize and return snapshot

```python
snapshot = await execution.async_close()
```

What close does, in order:

1. seal (if not already sealed)
2. drain pending tasks
3. close the runtime stream
4. freeze and return the close snapshot

`timeout=` on close is the **drain timeout** — the maximum wait for in-flight tasks before forcing the close. It is not the auto-close timer.

## auto_close and auto_close_timeout

`auto_close=True` (the default for `create_execution`) means the execution will close itself after `auto_close_timeout` seconds of being **idle** — no chunks running, no events to process, no pending pause.

| Source | Default `auto_close_timeout` |
|---|---|
| `flow.create_execution(...)` | `10.0` seconds |
| `flow.start(...)` / `flow.async_start(...)` (hidden sugar) | `0.0` seconds (close as soon as idle) |

`pause_for(...)` pauses the auto-close timer. After `continue_with(...)`, the idle timer starts fresh.

`close()` / `async_close()` reject pending interrupts by default. Resume them first, or explicitly cancel them with `pending_interrupts="cancel"` when shutdown should abandon the wait.

Close also releases execution-local transient aggregation state such as partial
`when(mode="and")`, `batch`, `collect`, `for_each`, and `match` bookkeeping.
These scratch keys are not part of the durable close snapshot.

`auto_close_timeout=None` disables auto-close — the execution stays alive until you call `close()` explicitly. **Don't combine `auto_close_timeout=None` with hidden sugar** — `flow.start()` would never return.

## Execution snapshot and load

`execution.save()` returns a serializable execution snapshot. For restart-safe
and host-managed recovery paths, that snapshot is the versioned top-level
TriggerFlow recovery contract:

```python
saved = execution.save()
```

The execution snapshot records:

- `schema_version`, `kind`, `snapshot_id`, and `state_version`.
- execution identity, flow name, run context, lifecycle/status, owner, heartbeat,
  and lease fields.
- runtime state, flow data, pending interrupts, intervention ledger,
  sub-flow frames, last signal, and compatible result state.
- `durable_system_state`: TriggerFlow-owned progress that must survive
  open/waiting execution load, such as partial `when(mode="and")`
  aggregation state.
- `resource_requirements`: live resource keys and ExecutionResource
  requirements needed before the restored graph can safely continue.
- `resume_ledger`: accepted `continue_with(..., resume_request_id=...)` requests
  so an external resume retry does not dispatch the graph twice.

Live resource objects are not serialized. `runtime_resources`, managed
ExecutionResource handles, clients, callbacks, and other live objects remain
outside the saved state. `runtime_resources` is only the mount point for live
objects that the host has already created, restored, and validated.

Declare resources that a future resumed chunk will need. TriggerFlow can record
resources that are already mounted, but it cannot infer a resource used only by a
later branch unless you declare it:

```python
flow.declare_resource_requirement("resume_service")
```

Workers that can import the same resource factory can persist a resolver
descriptor instead of passing the live object manually on every restart:

```python
flow.declare_resource_requirement(
    "resume_service",
    resolver="my_app.runtime_resources:create_resume_service",
    provider_kind="approval_router",
    config_ref="settings://approval-service",
    secret_ref="secret://approval-service",
    fail_policy="fail_closed",
)
```

The resolver receives a context dictionary with the resource key, requirement,
execution id, snapshot, and execution handle. It should return the live
resource or an envelope such as `{"resource": service, "health": "healthy"}`.
If the resolver is missing, unhealthy, or policy-forbidden,
`inspect_load(...)` reports typed diagnostics. `fail_policy="fail_open"`
keeps the diagnostic as a warning; the default `fail_closed` blocks strict
`async_load(...)`.

Use `inspect_load(...)` or strict `async_load(...)` before resuming:

```python
saved = execution.save()

report = restored.inspect_load(saved)
assert report["missing_resource_keys"] == ["resume_service"]

await restored.async_load(
    saved,
    runtime_resources={"resume_service": service},
)
await restored.async_continue_with(
    interrupt_id,
    {"approved": True},
    resume_request_id="webhook-42",
    actor="approval-service",
)
```

`async_load(...)` loads the snapshot, restores declared ExecutionResource
requirements, re-ensures managed execution resources, and fails
before graph continuation if required resources are still missing. Use
`load(...)` only when all required resources are already available in the
current process and no async resource preparation is needed. Pass
`validate_resources=True` for the same fail-fast resource check. Use
`async_load(...)` for restart or worker-handoff paths that may need async
resource resolution or managed environment setup before graph continuation.
Production boundaries are covered in [Distributed Pause and Resume Boundaries](distributed-pause-resume.md).

External execution snapshot stores can persist the same snapshot by exposing
`put_snapshot(run_id, state, step_id=...)`. Durable providers can additionally
expose `get_snapshot(run_id)` for reading snapshot state,
`put_snapshot(..., expected_state_version=...)`, lease methods, and
`put_artifact_ref(...)`. A Workspace can be configured directly because it
implements the same snapshot-store port:

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(workspace=agent.workspace)
snapshot_ref = await execution.async_save(step_id="after-approval")
```

For shared task information, prefer a Workspace instance that the application
creates and owns explicitly:

```python
shared_workspace = Agently.create_workspace("./.agently/projects/issue-123")
execution = flow.create_execution(workspace=shared_workspace)
```

`flow.create_execution()` binds the current session/script default Workspace by
default and assigns the execution its own scoped file root under
`files/lineage/<root-kind>/<root-id>/.../execution/<execution-id>/files`.
Pass `workspace=False` to opt out, or pass a Workspace instance, path, or
backend when the execution should use an explicitly selected Workspace. The
resolved execution-local Workspace facade is available to TriggerFlow chunks as
`runtime_resources["workspace"]` / `data.require_resource("workspace")`.

It is a live resource, not serialized state. If a chunk needs an Agent to use
the same explicit information scope, bind that Agent or the single
AgentExecution to the same Workspace in application code. If a flow needs to
move data between two isolated Workspaces, do it explicitly in the flow's
business logic with
Workspace `search(...)`, `get(...)`, `get_data(...)`, `put(...)`, `ingest(...)`,
and `link(...)`. Workspace itself does not provide a cross-space communication
or replication protocol.

You can also pass a store through existing execution resources when a service
does not use `workspace=...`:

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(
    runtime_resources={"snapshot_store": agent.workspace}
)
snapshot_ref = await execution.async_save(step_id="after-approval")
```

To resume from a Workspace-backed snapshot, read the stored snapshot and pass it
back to TriggerFlow's load API:

```python
saved_state = await agent.workspace.get_snapshot(execution.run_context.run_id)
assert saved_state is not None

restored = flow.create_execution(workspace=agent.workspace)
await restored.async_load(saved_state, runtime_resources={"workspace": agent.workspace})
await restored.async_continue_with(
    "approval",
    {"approved": True},
    resume_request_id="approval-webhook-1",
    actor="reviewer",
)
```

This path preserves TriggerFlow-owned pause/resume ledgers, policy-approval
waits, and `when(..., mode="and")` join progress while keeping Workspace as the
snapshot provider.

For a runnable foundation check of this path, use
`examples/trigger_flow/durable_recovery.py`. It writes a Workspace-backed
snapshot, loads it in a fresh execution, resumes with a stable
`resume_request_id`, and proves duplicate callback delivery does not execute the
downstream chunk twice.

For a service-shaped provider replacement example, use
`examples/trigger_flow/fastapi_sqlite_exchange_provider.py`. It keeps the flow
definition in a module-level `discount_approval_flow` object with top-level
`.to(...)` / `.when(...)` wiring, stores top-level execution snapshots in
SQLite, publishes approval requests through a SQLite
`ExecutionExchangeProvider`, and exposes the same start/resume path through
FastAPI.

TriggerFlow carries owner/lease fields in the snapshot and exposes
`claim_lease(...)` / `heartbeat_lease(...)` so a store can index and project
distributed ownership. The store still owns cross-worker atomic writes, lease
enforcement, access control, and conflict handling.
Before `continue_with(...)` accepts a resume request, callbacks delivered to an
execution whose execution-local lease has already expired fail fast without
writing a resume ledger entry; a reclaimed worker should load or claim the
execution first, then process the same stable `resume_request_id`.

Workspace-backed providers expose the corresponding lease port:

```python
lease = await agent.workspace.claim_lease(
    execution.run_context.run_id,
    "worker-1",
    ttl=30.0,
    expected_state_version=snapshot_state_version,
)
await agent.workspace.heartbeat_lease(
    execution.run_context.run_id,
    "worker-1",
    lease["lease_token"],
)
```

When a service wants to use an execution snapshot for host-managed distributed
recovery, request a fail-closed provider check:

```python
await execution.async_save(
    step_id="after-approval",
    require_distributed_provider=True,
)
```

The selected snapshot provider must report CAS, lease, range-read, and
retention capabilities and expose the matching snapshot, lease, and artifact
methods. The execution must also have a RuntimeEvent store that reports event
sequencing. The local Workspace backend passes this fail-closed provider check
for single-node development and local restart recovery, but it is not a
production cross-worker Redis/Postgres/object-storage backend.

For durable diagnostics, bind a RuntimeEvent store through execution resources:

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(
    runtime_resources={"runtime_event_store": agent.workspace}
)
await execution.async_start(request)
events = await agent.workspace.query_runtime_events(execution.id)
```

TriggerFlow still owns event identity, pause/resume semantics, DAG readiness,
and replay validation. Workspace stores the canonical RuntimeEvent records and
snapshot refs; it does not become a workflow control plane.

Durable RuntimeEvent records include the execution-local sequence,
`state_version`, parent event/signal lineage, aggregation scope, operator id,
interrupt id, resume request id, actor id, lease owner id, snapshot ref, and
artifact refs. `pause_for(...)` writes planned, persisted, and exposed
interrupt phases; `continue_with(..., resume_request_id=...)` writes accepted,
dispatched, completed, and `dispatch_failed` resume phases. Use a stable
`resume_request_id` from the external callback, webhook, or approval request so
retry delivery remains idempotent after restart.

`pause_for(...)` can also persist an ExternalWait template for external
approval, webhook, or exchange-style waits:

```python
await data.async_pause_for(
    type="exchange", exchange_kind="approval",
    payload={"question": "approve?"},
    interrupt_id="approval",
    resume_to="next",
    channel_id="ops-approval",
    provider_id="approval-router",
    wait_mode="connected_then_disconnected",
    hot_wait_timeout=30.0,
    cold_persistence_policy="persist",
    request_payload_schema={"type": "object"},
    response_payload_schema={"type": "object", "required": ["approved"]},
    audit_metadata={"exchange_id": "approval-exchange-1"},
)
```

The template is stored under `interrupt.external_wait_request` in the
execution snapshot. If `audit_metadata.exchange_id` is present, TriggerFlow projects it
onto durable RuntimeEvent records through Workspace or any compatible runtime
event provider that accepts `exchange_id`.

When a host owns an approval router, queue, or exchange transport, bind an
execution-local `execution_exchange_provider`. The provider publishes the same
typed request after the interrupt is persisted and before it is marked exposed;
TriggerFlow remains the lifecycle owner and resumes through
`continue_with(...)`:

```python
class QueueExchangeProvider:
    async def publish_request(self, execution_id, request, *, interrupt):
        ticket = await queue.publish({
            "execution_id": execution_id,
            "request": request,
            "interrupt": interrupt,
        })
        return {
            "exchange_id": ticket["id"],
            "provider_metadata": {"queue": ticket["queue"]},
        }

execution = flow.create_execution(
    runtime_resources={"execution_exchange_provider": QueueExchangeProvider()}
)
```

The provider may return `exchange_id`, `provider_metadata`, and
`audit_metadata`; those fields are merged into
`interrupt.external_wait_request` and projected to durable RuntimeEvent records.
If provider publishing fails, TriggerFlow records `dispatch_state` as
`exposure_failed` and emits `triggerflow.interrupt_exposure_failed`.

For long-running executions, keep large payloads behind provider refs and store
only compaction facts in the execution snapshot by configuring a host-owned
reducer policy. The reducer receives the bounded RuntimeEvent
records selected by TriggerFlow and returns serializable summary facts plus any
large payload that should be stored behind a provider artifact ref:

```python
async def compact_execution_state(context):
    records = context["records"]
    return {
        "summary": f"compacted {len(records)} runtime events",
        "artifact": {"event_ids": [record["event_id"] for record in records]},
        "retained_lineage_anchors": [{
            "anchor_id": "root-after-compaction",
            "sequence": context["sequence_from"],
            "event_id": records[0]["event_id"],
        }],
        "load_read_limit": 100,
    }

execution.set_compaction_policy(
    min_runtime_events=100,
    reducer=compact_execution_state,
    artifact_kind="snapshot_payload",
)
await execution.async_save(step_id="auto-compacted")
```

`inspect_load(...)` reports retained lineage anchor mismatches, missing
required artifact refs, and invalid load read limits as snapshot
diagnostics. TriggerFlow records the execution facts and provider refs; the
Workspace or enterprise provider owns artifact storage, retention anchors, and
bounded runtime-event reads.

`execution.inspect_load(...)` reports typed recovery diagnostics for
invalid snapshots, missing resources, accepted-but-not-dispatched resume
requests, dispatched-but-not-completed resume requests, expired lease warnings,
active lease owner conflicts, DAG join state mismatches, TaskDAG graph
fingerprint mismatch, and durable RuntimeEvent sequence or parent-signal
lineage problems when event records are inspected.

## Picking the right entry

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Quick script, all inputs known up front | `flow.start(...)` / `flow.async_start(...)` |
| Service that needs to keep emitting / consuming runtime stream | `flow.start_execution(...)` |
| Need `pause_for(...)` (human approval, async webhook) | `flow.create_execution(auto_close=False)` + `execution.async_start(...)` + manual `close()` |
| Need to save and resume across restarts | `create_execution(...)` + `execution.save()` / `load()` |

## A quick decision example

```python
# This flow pauses for user input — DO NOT use flow.start()
flow = TriggerFlow(name="approval")
async def ask(data):
    return await data.async_pause_for(type="exchange", exchange_kind="approval", resume_to="next")
async def commit(data):
    await data.async_set_state("approved", data.input)
flow.to(ask).to(commit)

execution = flow.create_execution(auto_close=False)
await execution.async_start(None)
# ... wait for an external system to call execution.async_continue_with(...) ...
snapshot = await execution.async_close()
```

If you'd written `await flow.async_start(None)` instead, TriggerFlow would raise when `pause_for(...)` is reached because the hidden execution has no resumable handle.

If you need to stop a waiting execution without resuming it, make that explicit:

```python
snapshot = await execution.async_close(pending_interrupts="cancel")
```

## Compatibility parameters

| Parameter | Status |
|---|---|
| `wait_for_result=True` / `False` | **value is ignored**, warning emitted; return type is governed by `auto_close` |
| `set_result()` / `get_result()` / `.end()` | deprecated; see [Compatibility](compatibility.md) |
| `runtime_data` (`get_runtime_data` / `set_runtime_data` etc.) | deprecated alias of `state`; see [State and Resources](state-and-resources.md) |
