    """Materialize a Workspace-issued file boundary into the provider context.

    Resolves the first usable candidate root, ensures it exists and is a writable
    directory, and returns it as an execution-ready working directory. The
    failure for a missing or unusable boundary belongs at the ExecutionResource
    provider boundary, not inside each Bash/Node/Python executor (spec section
    8.6): if a candidate root is supplied but cannot be materialized safely, this
    raises ``ExecutionResourceError`` before the operation starts.

    Returns ``None`` only when no candidate boundary was supplied at all; the
    caller decides whether that is allowed (in-process sandboxes that do not
    touch the filesystem) or must itself fail closed (file-touching executors).
