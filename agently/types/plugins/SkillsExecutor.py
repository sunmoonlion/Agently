"""Skills Executor plugin protocol surfaces.

This module groups four Protocol declarations because they form one tightly
coupled boundary, even though only one is a plugin-manager-managed protocol:

- ``SkillsExecutor`` is the plugin protocol implemented by framework and
  third-party Skills Executor plugins. ``PluginManager`` resolves it from
  ``builtins.plugins.SkillsExecutor``.
- ``SkillsPlanningContext`` / ``SkillsExecutionContext`` /
  ``SkillsRuntimeContext`` are SPI surfaces implemented by the Agent and
  injected at planning / execution time. They are not plugins; they describe
  what the Agent gives the plugin.

Splitting these into separate files would obscure that injection direction and
duplicate type imports. New context Protocols that follow the same SPI shape
should be added here; new plugin Protocols belong in their own file.
