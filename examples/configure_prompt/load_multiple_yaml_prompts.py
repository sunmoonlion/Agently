# Expected output (deterministic — no model call):
# The serialized prompt text for the "prompt_1" section of multiple_yaml_prompts.yaml.
#
# How it works:
# load_yaml_prompt() with prompt_key_path="prompt_1" selects a single named section
# from a multi-prompt YAML file, letting you keep several prompt variants in one file
# and load the right one at runtime without splitting into multiple files.
# The selected section is captured by create_execution() as a one-run prompt
# draft and then serialized to text via execution.get_prompt_text().
