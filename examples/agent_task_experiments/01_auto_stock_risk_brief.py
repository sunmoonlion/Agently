Run date: 2026-07-02

Source facts:
- [Q1] NVDA, AMD, and AVGO are the covered semiconductor tickers.
- [Q2] The desk has only delayed quote snapshots in this packet, so the brief must not
  claim live market prices.
- [N1] AI accelerator demand remains the strongest common growth theme.
- [N2] Supply concentration, export controls, customer capex timing, and valuation
  sensitivity are common downside risks.
- [N3] Broadcom has a more diversified mix across custom silicon, networking, and
  infrastructure software than NVDA or AMD in this packet.
- [P1] Compliance policy: do not issue buy/sell/hold calls, target prices, or
  personalized investment advice.
