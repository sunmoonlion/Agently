Week: 2026-06-24 to 2026-07-01

Engineering signals:
- [S1] Agent teams are moving from single prompt demos toward observable task
  execution, action logs, and recoverable workspace artifacts.
- [S2] Long-output reliability depends on writing artifacts to a workspace and
  verifying bounded readbacks instead of pushing every byte through final text.
- [S3] Search and browse tools should expose partial success and bounded evidence
  when concurrent sources fail.
- [S4] Code-writing agents need runtime preflight before selecting Python, Node.js,
  Go, or C++.
- [S5] Event-driven frontier scheduling can reduce wait time when independent
  branches finish at different times.
