## ToDo + Concurrent Execution — model plans, asyncio executes in parallel
#
# Pattern:
#   1. Model decomposes a goal into a task list with explicit dependency annotations.
#   2. Classify tasks: independent (no deps) vs dependent (must wait for others).
#   3. Run independent tasks concurrently with asyncio.gather().
#   4. Run dependent tasks sequentially after their prerequisites complete.
#
# This pattern is useful when sub-tasks are I/O-bound (API calls, file ops, DB queries)
# and can safely run in parallel without interfering with each other.

#
# How it works:
# The model outputs a JSON task graph where each task lists the IDs it depends on.
# Tasks with an empty depends_on list can safely run concurrently.
# asyncio.gather() launches all independent tasks simultaneously; each awaits a
# simulated delay (replace with real async I/O such as aiohttp, asyncpg, or aiofiles).
# Dependent tasks are then executed sequentially, respecting ordering constraints.
# The speedup ratio shows how much time concurrency saves versus serial execution.
#
# Flow:
# plan_tasks(goal)
#   model outputs task graph: [t1 (no deps), t2 (deps: t1), t3 (no deps), ...]
#   |
#   v
# classify: independent=[t1, t3], dependent=[t2, ...]
#   |
#   v
# asyncio.gather(execute_task(t1), execute_task(t3))  <- run in parallel
#   |
#   v
# execute_task(t2)  <- waits until this point (t1 is done)
#   |
#   v
# all results collected and printed
