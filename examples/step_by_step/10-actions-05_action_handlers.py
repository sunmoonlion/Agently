## Action Handler Injection — intercept planning and execution phases
#
# The action pipeline has two injectable phases:
#
#   PLANNING PHASE:  the model (or your handler) decides which actions to call next.
#   EXECUTION PHASE: Agently (or your handler) runs those calls and returns results.
#
# Injecting a handler at either phase lets you:
#   • Audit or log planned calls before execution
#   • Override model decisions with deterministic Python logic
#   • Add pre/post hooks around execution (timing, validation, retries)
#
# API:
#   agent.register_action_planning_handler(fn)   — replaces the model-driven planner
#   agent.register_action_execution_handler(fn)  — wraps action execution


# --- Mock action functions ---

# Expected output (demo_execution_handler):
# [Planning] Round 0, actions completed so far: 0
# [Execution] Starting: lookup_price({'item': 'laptop'})
# [Execution] Done:     lookup_price in 0.0002s — result: {'item': 'laptop', 'price': 1299.99}
#
# [Planning] Round 1, actions completed so far: 1
# [Execution] Starting: apply_discount({'price': 1299.99, 'discount_pct': 15})
# [Execution] Done:     apply_discount in 0.0001s — result: {'original': 1299.99, ..., 'discounted': 1104.99}
#
# [Planning] Round 2 → next_action: response
# A laptop costs $1299.99; after a 15% discount you pay $1104.99 (saving $195.00).
#
# How it works:
# Planning handler (Augmented):
#   receives context={round_index, done_plans, ...} + request={action_list}
#   delegates to runtime._default_planning_handler() for model-based decisions
#   logs/filters the resulting action_calls before returning them
#
# Planning handler (Scripted):
#   inspects done_plans to determine what step we're on
#   returns hard-coded action_calls without any model call
#   returns next_action='response' when all steps are done
#
# Execution handler:
#   receives context={action, settings, ...} + request={action_calls, concurrency}
#   runs each action call via action.async_execute_action() with timing wraparound
#   returns list[ActionResult] — same format injected before get_result() consumption
#
# Flow (demo_execution_handler with scripted planning):
# agent.get_action_result(prompt=turn.prompt)
#   Round 0: scripted_planning_handler -> lookup_price(laptop)
#            timed_execution_handler  -> result: {price: 1299.99}
#   Round 1: scripted_planning_handler -> apply_discount(1299.99, 15)
#            timed_execution_handler  -> result: {discounted: 1104.99}
#   Round 2: scripted_planning_handler -> next_action='response'
# agent.get_result()
#   model reads action records -> final reply
