# Expected key output with Ollama running:
# [ACTION_RECORDS] includes a successful run_python call with model_digest and artifact_refs.
# [ACTION_RESULTS_INJECTED_TO_REPLY] contains average=20.0, count=5, and max_minus_min_gap=34.
# [ACTION_CALL_HANDLES_AFTER_RELEASE] prints [].

# How it works:
# agent.enable_python(expose_to_model=True) registers a Python sandbox action that the
# model can plan and call.  get_action_result() asks Ollama to generate the Python code
# for the statistics task, runs it in the sandbox, and returns ActionResult records.
# get_result() injects the records so the model can reference the exact numeric results
# in its final reply.  Action-call-scoped handles are released after get_action_result().
#
# Flow:
# agent.enable_python(expose_to_model=True)
#   |
#   v
# model plans: run_python(python_code="nums=[15,23,42,8,12]\nresult={...}")
#   |
#   v
# ManagedPythonEnvironment runs code -> average=20.0, count=5, max_minus_min_gap=34
# ActionResult(model_digest=..., artifact_refs=[...])
#   |
#   v
# model reply: "average=20.0, count=5, max-minus-min gap=34"
# handle released -> list(scope="action_call") == []
