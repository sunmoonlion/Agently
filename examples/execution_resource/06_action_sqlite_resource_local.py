# Expected key output:
# [ACTION_RESULT] has status="success".
# data["rows"] contains "Execution environment health check" priority 1 and
# "Action package examples" priority 2.
# Action-call execution environment handles are released after the call.

# How it works:
# agent.enable_sqlite(database=str(db_path), action_id=ACTION_ID) registers a SQLite
# query action backed by a temp-dir database.  execute_action() runs a parameterized
# SELECT with params=[2], returning rows as a list of dicts.  The temp dir is cleaned
# up by the context manager after the assertions run.
#
# Flow:
# prepare_database(db_path): INSERT 3 issues into a temp SQLite file
#   |
#   v
# agent.enable_sqlite(database=str(db_path), action_id=ACTION_ID)
# execute_action(ACTION_ID, {"query":"SELECT... WHERE priority<=?","params":[2]})
#   |
#   v
# SQLiteEnvironment runs query -> rows = [
#   {"title":"Execution environment health check","priority":1},
#   {"title":"Action package examples","priority":2}]
# handle released -> list(scope="action_call") == []
