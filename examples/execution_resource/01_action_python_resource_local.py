# Expected key output:
# [ACTION_RESULT] has status="success" and data["result"] equals
# {"average": 20.0, "count": 5, "max_minus_min_gap": 34}.
# [ACTION_CALL_HANDLES_AFTER_RELEASE] prints [].

# How it works:
# agent.enable_python(action_id=ACTION_ID, expose_to_model=False) registers a managed
# Python sandbox action without exposing it to the model (direct execution only).
# execute_action() calls the action directly with python_code as a list of code lines.
# The sandbox runs the code, reads the `result` variable, and returns it.
# After the call, Agently.execution_resource.list(scope="action_call") returns []
# because action-call-scoped handles are released automatically when the call ends.
#
# Flow:
# agent.enable_python(action_id=ACTION_ID, expose_to_model=False)
#   |
#   v
# agent.action.execute_action(ACTION_ID, {"python_code": [...]})
#   | (no model call)
#   v
# ManagedPythonEnvironment runs code -> result = {"average":20.0,"count":5,"max_minus_min_gap":34}
#   |
#   v
# handle released (scope="action_call") -> list(scope="action_call") == []
