# Execution Resource Examples

These examples show the recommended developer path for managed execution
capabilities.

Most application code should start with `agent.enable_*` helpers or built-in
action packages. They hide the core manager/provider lifecycle and expose
model-callable Actions with sensible defaults.

## Start Here

| File | Audience | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| `01_action_python_resource_local.py` | App developers, no model required | Enable a managed Python action with `agent.enable_python(...)` and call it directly for a deterministic local check. |
| `02_agent_python_resource_ollama.py` | App developers with local Ollama | Let a model decide to call the enabled Python action before replying. |
| `03_agent_issue_processor_deepseek.py` | App developers with DeepSeek | A realistic issue-triage task where the model uses Python for deterministic metrics and then writes the summary. |
| `04_triggerflow_python_resource_local.py` | Workflow/framework developers | Inject a managed Python sandbox into TriggerFlow `runtime_resources`. |
| `05_action_nodejs_resource_local.py` | App developers, no model required | Enable a managed Node.js action and execute JavaScript through the Node provider. |
| `06_action_sqlite_resource_local.py` | App developers, no model required | Enable a managed SQLite query action against a local database file. |
| `07_browser_resource_browse_local.py` | Action/plugin developers | Browse a local page through Browser Execution Resource. |
| `08_health_check_reuse_local.py` | Provider/plugin developers | Show V2 health-check-before-reuse behavior with a custom provider. |

## Copy-Paste Shape

For application developers, the shape is intentionally small:

```python
agent = Agently.create_agent()
agent.enable_python(desc="Use for exact calculations. Assign the final answer to `result`.")

turn = agent.input("Use Python to calculate the average of [15, 23, 42, 8, 12].")
records = agent.get_action_result(prompt=turn.prompt)
result = turn.get_result()
```

You normally do not need to call `Agently.execution_resource` directly. The
Action dispatcher ensures and releases the managed environment when the enabled
action is called.

## Example Details

- `01_action_python_resource_local.py`
  - Runs without any model API key.
  - Uses `agent.enable_python(...)`, then calls the registered action directly.
  - Good for verifying the local package without a model endpoint.
- `02_agent_python_resource_ollama.py`
  - Uses an Ollama OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
  - Defaults to `qwen2.5:7b`, which is sufficient for the small action-selection task.
  - Lets the model choose the managed Python action, then prints action records and the final reply.
- `03_agent_issue_processor_deepseek.py`
  - Uses DeepSeek for a more complex issue-processing prompt.
  - Shows that execution is real: model planning calls the Python action, the sandbox computes metrics, and the final reply uses those action results.
- `04_triggerflow_python_resource_local.py`
  - Runs without any model API key.
  - Injects a managed Python sandbox into TriggerFlow `runtime_resources`.
  - This is intentionally lower-level than the first three examples.
- `05_action_nodejs_resource_local.py`
  - Runs without any model API key.
  - Requires `node` on `PATH`; otherwise it prints a skip message.
  - Demonstrates `agent.enable_nodejs(...)` and action-call-scoped release.
- `06_action_sqlite_resource_local.py`
  - Runs without any model API key.
  - Creates a temporary SQLite database and queries it through `agent.enable_sqlite(...)`.
- `07_browser_resource_browse_local.py`
  - Runs without any model API key.
  - Requires Playwright and Chromium; otherwise it prints a skip message.
  - Demonstrates `Browse(use_browser_environment=True)` with a managed browser resource.
- `08_health_check_reuse_local.py`
  - Runs without any model API key.
  - Creates a local manager and provider to show that unhealthy ready handles are released and replaced before reuse.

Before running the Ollama example, make sure Ollama is running and the model is
available:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
```

Optional Ollama environment variables:

- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, defaults to `http://localhost:11434/v1`
- `OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL`, defaults to `qwen2.5:7b`

Before running the DeepSeek example, set:

- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, optional, defaults to `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`
- `DEEPSEEK_DEFAULT_MODEL`, optional, defaults to `deepseek-chat`

Run:

```bash
python examples/execution_resource/01_action_python_resource_local.py
python examples/execution_resource/02_agent_python_resource_ollama.py
python examples/execution_resource/03_agent_issue_processor_deepseek.py
python examples/execution_resource/04_triggerflow_python_resource_local.py
python examples/execution_resource/05_action_nodejs_resource_local.py
python examples/execution_resource/06_action_sqlite_resource_local.py
python examples/execution_resource/07_browser_resource_browse_local.py
python examples/execution_resource/08_health_check_reuse_local.py
```

Notes:

- Execution Resource declarations are lazy; a declaration does not start a sandbox or transport.
- Business examples should prefer `agent.enable_python(...)`, `agent.enable_shell(...)`, `agent.enable_workspace_file_actions(...)`, `agent.enable_nodejs(...)`, and `agent.enable_sqlite(...)` over direct manager/provider APIs.
- Built-in providers currently cover MCP, Bash, Python, Node, Docker, Browser, and SQLite. Search is intentionally not an Execution Resource provider; configure proxy, timeout, backend, and region on `agently.builtins.actions.Search(...)`.
- Ready handles are health-checked before reuse. Unhealthy handles emit `execution_resource.unhealthy`, are released, and are replaced with fresh handles.
- `enable_*` helpers provide default action descriptions, so `desc=` is optional. By default `desc=` appends extra guidance; `desc_mode="override"` replaces the default description only when you need full control.
- Action dispatch ensures required environments immediately before executor calls.
- `action_call` scoped handles are released after the action call.
- TriggerFlow still exposes live resources through `runtime_resources`; managed resources are injected by Execution Resource and released when the execution closes.
