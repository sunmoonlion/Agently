# Expected key output with Playwright and Chromium installed:
# [ACTION_RESULT] has status="success".
# The extracted content contains "Managed Browser Browse".
# Action-call browser environment handles are released after the call.

# How it works:
# agent.enable_browser(action_id=ACTION_ID) registers a managed browser action.
# serve_directory() starts a local HTTP server in a temp dir with an index.html file
# containing "Managed Browser Browse" in the body.  execute_action() browses the URL,
# extracts clean text, and returns it.  Assertions check the content and that handles
# are released after the action-call scope ends.
#
# Flow:
# serve_directory(root) -> http://127.0.0.1:<port>
# agent.enable_browser(action_id=ACTION_ID)
# execute_action(ACTION_ID, {"url": "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/index.html"})
#   |
#   v
# BrowserEnvironment fetches + extracts -> {"status":"success","data":"...Managed Browser Browse..."}
# handle released -> list(scope="action_call") == []
