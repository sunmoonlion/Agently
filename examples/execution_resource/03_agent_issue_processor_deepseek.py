# Expected key output after configuring DeepSeek:
# [ACTION_RECORDS] includes a successful run_python call with deterministic issue metrics.
# The metrics include label_count=3, comment_count=3, triggerflow_involved=True,
# devtools_involved=True, and severity_score=6.
# [ACTION_CALL_HANDLES_AFTER_RELEASE] prints [].

# How it works:
# Same pattern as 02 but uses DeepSeek and a GitHub issue payload as input.
# The model writes Python code to compute deterministic metrics from the issue dict
# (label_count, comment_count, severity_score) then summarizes the issue for triage.
# temperature=0.1 minimizes variation in the scoring code the model generates.
