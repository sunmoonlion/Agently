# Agently DevTools Examples

These examples show the core DevTools integration paths from the main Agently repo.

Before running them:

```bash
pip install -U agently agently-devtools
```

Observation and evaluation examples also need the local DevTools listener:

```bash
agently-devtools start
```

For the interactive wrapper examples, starting the listener is also recommended when you want to inspect Agent or TriggerFlow runs in the DevTools console while using the browser UI.

Examples in this folder:

**ObservationBridge** (Passive monitoring):
- `01_observation_bridge_local.py`
  Uses `Agently.create_observation_bridge(...).watch(Agently)` to upload one simple TriggerFlow run.
- `02_observation_bridge_selective_watch.py`
  Uses `Agently.create_observation_bridge(watched_flow, ...)` so only the selected flow is uploaded.
- `03_scenario_evaluations.py`
  Uses `EvaluationBridge` and `EvaluationRunner` to run a small repeatable suite.
- `07_agently_observe_lazy_bridge.py`
  Uses `Agently.observe(flow, ...)` to lazily load DevTools and watch one TriggerFlow without importing `agently_devtools` in app code.
- `08_model_request_telemetry_local.py`
  Registers a local Event Center hook and shows `payload.model_request_telemetry` on model request RuntimeEvents; this is an infrastructure probe and does not require a real model provider.

**InteractiveWrapper** (Active interaction):
- `04_interactive_wrapper_basic.py`
  Uses `InteractiveWrapper()` with a generator callable to stream text chunks into the interactive chat UI, and also shows how to register the example with `ObservationBridge`.
- `05_interactive_wrapper_agent.py`
  Uses `InteractiveWrapper()` with an Agently Agent so token output can stream into the UI when the configured model supports it, while Agent runs are also published to DevTools via `ObservationBridge`.
- `06_interactive_wrapper_trigger_flow.py`
  Uses `InteractiveWrapper()` with a TriggerFlow that emits stage updates before returning the final structured result, while TriggerFlow runs are also published to DevTools via `ObservationBridge`.

Default local listeners:

**ObservationBridge & EvaluationBridge** (Devtools workbench):
- Console: `http://127.0.0.1:15596/`
- Ingest: `http://127.0.0.1:15596/observation/ingest`

**InteractiveWrapper** (Interactive demo UI):
- Default port: `15365` (similar to AGENT key positions)
- General usage: `python <example_file>`
- Access the interactive UI in your browser: `http://127.0.0.1:15365/`
- The built-in page uses `/api/stream` first and falls back to `/api/chat` only when the wrapped provider does not support streaming.
- `04_interactive_wrapper_basic.py` keeps the provider as a plain callable, so it focuses on wrapper streaming; `05` and `06` are the examples that also produce Agently runtime observation data in DevTools.

All examples avoid external model dependencies so they can be used as integration smoke tests.
