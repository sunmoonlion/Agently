# Expected key output with DeepSeek or local Ollama configured:
# [MODEL_PROVIDER] prints deepseek or ollama.
# [ACTION_RECORDS] includes a successful pwd call and an approval_required ls call.
# The blocked ls record has error "cmd_not_allowed"; the command is not executed.

# How it works:
# A bash sandbox action is registered with two policies: "pwd" is allowed (side_effect_level
# = "read") and "ls" requires approval (side_effect_level = "exec", approval_required=True).
# The model plans both commands; the sandbox allows pwd but blocks ls with an error.
# The shell is never executed for the blocked command — only the policy check runs.
#
# Flow:
# agent.enable_shell(allowed_commands=["pwd","ls"], policies={...})
#   |
#   v
# model plans: bash_exec(cmd="pwd") -> BashEnvironment runs -> stdout = <repo_root>
# model plans: bash_exec(cmd="ls")  -> policy check: approval_required
#   -> error="cmd_not_allowed" returned, no shell execution
#   |
#   v
# [ACTION_RECORDS]: [{"cmd":"pwd","status":"success"}, {"cmd":"ls","status":"error",...}]
# assertion: pwd record has status="success", ls record has error="cmd_not_allowed"
