"""Standard SKILL.md skill that generates an architecture diagram.

Run:
    python examples/skills_executor/08_architecture_diagram_skill.py

Environment:
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in the shell or .env file.
    Set DYNAMIC_TASK_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama for local Ollama instead.

What this demonstrates
----------------------
A real task driven by the default single_shot compatibility route:

    * The capability is a single standard ``SKILL.md`` (frontmatter ``name`` /
      ``description`` / ``keywords`` + a Markdown design system). This example
      intentionally declares no execution metadata, so it stays on the default
      single_shot route label, lowered through Blocks to a model_request block.
    * ``agent.use_skills(["architecture-diagram"], mode="required")`` selects it.
      (``mode`` defaults to ``"model_decision"``; we force it here because we know
      exactly which skill must run.)
    * ``run_skills_task(...)`` builds a Blocks ExecutionPlan with
      ``skill_activation`` plus a ``model_request`` block, injects the full
      SKILL.md body as instructions, and returns a structured result shaped by
      ``output``.
    * The HOST owns the side effect: it writes the returned HTML to disk. The skill
      never touches the filesystem.

The task: draw a real architecture diagram for the current Agently development line. The
architecture brief below is grounded in this repository (agently/core +
agently/builtins), so the diagram describes the actual framework, not a guess.

Expected key output (shape; exact bytes vary by model):
    selected skill: architecture-diagram (required)
    skill status: success
    html bytes: ~6,000-20,000
    diagram saved: .../agently_architecture_generated.html

AGENTLY_ARCHITECTURE_BRIEF = """\
Draw the architecture of the current Agently framework development line. Agently is
layered execution & development infrastructure. Show these layers as bands,
top to bottom, with the listed components:

1. Business Application (external/generic): user assistants, internal tools,
   automations, evaluators, workflows.
2. Developer Surface / Agent Components (facade colour): Agently (main facade),
   Agent, TriggerFlow, plus Agent Extensions (Skills, Action, Session/ChatSession,
   ConfigurePrompt, AutoFunc, KeyWaiter, StreamingPrint).
3. Core Contracts (core colour, from agently/core): Agent, Session, Prompt,
   ModelRequest, ModelRequestResult, DynamicTask, TaskDAGExecutor, TriggerFlow,
   ExecutionResource, Action, Tool, SkillsExecutor, PluginManager, EventCenter.
4. Plugins / Providers (plugin colour, from agently/builtins/plugins):
   ModelRequester (OpenAICompatible), PromptGenerator, ResponseParser,
   AgentOrchestrator, SkillsExecutor (SKILL.md compatibility labels backed by Blocks),
   TaskDAGPlanner,
   ActionExecutor, ActionFlow, ActionRuntime, ExecutionResourceProvider,
   ToolManager.
5. ExecutionResourceManager & Capabilities (capability colour): Sandbox,
   Process, Filesystem, Network, Credentials, MCP, Resources.
6. External Dependencies & Integrations (external colour): Model Providers
   (DeepSeek, Ollama, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), ChromaDB, FastAPI.
7. Runtime Events, Diagnostics & DevTools (event-bus colour): core EventCenter
   dispatches RuntimeEvent records; the main framework DevTools bridge projects
   them to ObservationEvent payloads consumed by the agently-devtools companion
   (observe / evaluate / playground). Core never imports the companion eagerly.

Key principle to convey: the separation rule
"core contract -> plugin/provider impl -> built-in capability Action ->
agent extension -> business application".

Title it "Agently Framework Architecture" with subtitle noting the current
development line.
