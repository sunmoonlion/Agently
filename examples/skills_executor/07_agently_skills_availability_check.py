# Agently-Skills pack availability check — developer pre-flight case.
#
# Scenario: Before wiring an Agently-Skills guidance pack into the framework-side
# Skills Executor, a developer wants to verify that every active skill can be
# installed and passes executor eligibility checks when explicitly selected.
# This is not an Agent auto-orchestration acceptance example and it does not
# prove model-owned route selection. This script:
#   1. Installs the active skills from a local Agently-Skills clone in a fresh
#      local registry.
#   2. Lists each installed skill with its purpose and activation hints.
#   3. Runs a plan-resolution check for every skill using required mode and the
#      deterministic planner — no model API key is needed.
#   4. Reports an overall availability verdict.
#
# The deterministic planner check is a lightweight "does the skill pass
# eligibility filters when named directly?" gate. It verifies trust level and
# required actions without calling the model. Guidance-only skills resolve
# immediately; skills that need missing actions surface a blocking reason code.
#
# Expected key output from one local run:
# pack_status=success
# installed_count=6
#
# Installed Agently-Skills (6):
#   agently:
#   agently-dynamic-task:
#   agently-migration:
#   agently-request:
#   agently-runtime:
#   agently-triggerflow:
#
# Availability check (deterministic planner, no model call):
#   agently              → resolved
#   agently-dynamic-task → resolved
#   agently-migration    → resolved
#   agently-request      → resolved
#   agently-runtime      → resolved
#   agently-triggerflow  → resolved
#
# all_available=True
#
# Skill activation hints:
#   agently:
#     keywords: []
#     invocation_names: []
#   ...
#
# Note: these guidance-only skills carry no activation keywords by default.
# Use this output only as registry/eligibility evidence. Route ownership and
# model-owned skill choice must be verified by separate model-backed examples.
