"""Goal Pursuit variant: self-install the public CocoonAI architecture-diagram skill.

Run:
    python examples/agent_task/agently_architecture_diagram_cocoon_skill_task.py

Environment:
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in the shell or .env file.
    Set AGENT_TASK_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama for local Ollama instead.

How this differs from agently_architecture_diagram_task.py
----------------------------------------------------------
The sibling example fed the model a *hand-written* ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_SKILL_GUIDANCE
rubric whose bullet points were then restated almost 1:1 in the success criteria,
judge rules, and the Mermaid-block smoke check (a circular hint).

This variant removes that inline rubric entirely. Instead the example **installs a
real, independently-authored public skill at runtime** -

    Cocoon-AI/architecture-diagram-generator  (subpath: architecture-diagram)

- via Agently's remote-skills mechanism, and lets the goal-pursuit loop use it as the
"how to draw" guidance. The skill dictates an HTML+SVG design system (colors, fonts,
spacing, export toolbar), so:
    * OUTPUT is a single .html file with inline SVG, not Mermaid markdown.
    * The trusted Skill may reference external font/export assets documented in
      its own design system.
    * The fetch action returns ONLY repository evidence (no embedded guidance).
    * The judge rules stay generic and are NOT a restatement of the skill, so the
      acceptance signal is no longer circular with the guidance.

The architectural content (which layers, ownership boundaries, edges) remains
model-owned and grounded in the supplied repository excerpts.
