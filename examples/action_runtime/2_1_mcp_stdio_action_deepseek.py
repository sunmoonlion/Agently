# Expected key output after configuring DeepSeek:
# [ACTION_RECORDS] includes MCP calculator action calls.
# The final computed value for (12.5 + 7.25) * 3 is 59.25.
# [MODEL_REPLY] reports 59.25.

# How it works:
# agent.use_mcp(script_path) spawns _calculator_mcp_server.py as a subprocess and
# communicates over stdin/stdout using the Model Context Protocol.
# The MCP server exposes add and multiply tools that the model can plan and call
# just like native Agently actions.  get_action_result() drives the full MCP call
# cycle; the subprocess is managed by Agently and torn down after the request.
#
# Flow:
# agent.use_mcp("_calculator_mcp_server.py")
#   | subprocess launched over stdio
#   v
# model plans: add(12.5, 7.25) -> 19.75
#              multiply(19.75, 3) -> 59.25
#   |
#   v
# ActionResult records returned
#   |
#   v
# model reply: "The result is 59.25."
