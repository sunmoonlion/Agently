# Expected key output after configuring DeepSeek:
# [ACTION_RECORDS] includes successful normalize_title and count_words calls.
# The normalized title is "action runtime plugin refactor".
# The exact word count is 4.

# How it works:
# agent.action.register_action() registers actions with an explicit action_id, desc,
# and kwargs schema rather than inferring them from a decorated function.
# Two actions are registered: normalize_title (strips whitespace, lowercases) and
# count_words.  The model plans both calls in sequence; each runs via
# FunctionActionExecutor and returns an ActionResult record that is injected before
# the final model reply.
#
# Flow:
# agent.input("normalize and count `  Action   Runtime   Plugin   Refactor  `")
#   |
#   v
# model plans: normalize_title(text="  Action   Runtime   Plugin   Refactor  ")
#              count_words(text="action runtime plugin refactor")
#   |
#   v
# FunctionActionExecutor -> "action runtime plugin refactor", 4
#   |
#   v
# ActionResult records injected
#   |
#   v
# model reply: "Normalized: 'action runtime plugin refactor'. Word count: 4."
