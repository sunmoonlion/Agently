# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# after provider credentials are configured, the full_url_instead_of_base_url.py snippet sends a request through that provider and prints the model response.
#
# How it works:
# full_url= replaces base_url= when you want to point at a specific endpoint path rather
# than letting Agently append "/chat/completions".  stream=False disables streaming and
# requests the full response in one shot.  content_mapping= (commented out) lets you remap
# non-standard response fields to Agently's expected keys for custom API wrappers.
