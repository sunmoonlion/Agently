# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# after provider credentials are configured, the BaiduErnie.py snippet sends a request through that provider and prints the model response.
#
# How it works:
# Baidu's QianFan platform exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at qianfan.baidubce.com/v2.
# Set auth="<QianFan API Key>" and model="ernie-4.5-turbo-128k" (or any ERNIE model).
# Structured output, streaming, and tool use work the same as with OpenAI-compatible models.
