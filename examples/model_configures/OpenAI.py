# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# after provider credentials are configured, the OpenAI.py snippet sends a request through that provider and prints the model response.
#
# How it works:
# OpenAI uses the OpenAI-compatible endpoint at api.openai.com/v1.
# Set auth="<OpenAI-API-Key>" and model="gpt-5" (or any available model).
# proxy= accepts an HTTP/HTTPS proxy URL string for environments that require one;
# omit it when connecting directly.
