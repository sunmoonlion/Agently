# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# after provider credentials are configured, the DeepSeek.py snippet sends a request through that provider and prints the model response.
#
# How it works:
# DeepSeek exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at api.deepseek.com/v1.
# Set auth="<DeepSeek API Key>" and model="deepseek-chat" (or "deepseek-reasoner" for R1).
# For the reasoning model, use get_generator(type="specific") and handle "reasoning_delta"
# events to separate chain-of-thought tokens from the final answer.
